# Simple classification with a perceptron in Processing3

In this project, supervised learning with gradient descent is used to train a simple perceptron to classify if a point is above or below the point y = x.
If the perceptron predicts the position of a point correctly, it is turns green. Else, it turns red.
When the program is run, the screen is populated with 150 random points, and the perceptron is initialized with random weights. This causes the screen to be filled with a mess of red and green filled dots.
But as the perceptron is stepping through iterations of training, we can see the all the points starting to turn green (signifying the fact that the perceptron is getting better and better at classifying the points).
